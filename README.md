# autoencoder_lstm
The dataset chosen is Austria's power consumption in 2015 : https://www.kaggle.com/francoisraucent/western-europe-power-consumption
It was to be observed that if atleast validation accuracy of LSTM increased with an encoded input from autoencoder. So far results are not promising
